## _Specifications_

  * _this page includes these css rules_

term | description | implementation
 --- | --- |---
border-box | this property effectively changes the way dimensions are measured for every element so it includes borders and padding.| i used this on the whole of the body so that the box sizing would be uniform, and easier to work with.
| float | An  option that assists in layout by allowing elements on the page to be placed next to each other in the layout (values include right or left). | i used this property to get my elements, whether they were images or divs,  next to each other in a uniform way.|
| clear fix | A technique commonly used in CSS float-based layouts is assigning a handful of CSS properties to an element which you know will contain floating elements. | I used this on my parent divs containing floats to keep them from collapsing after child elements were floated |
| display-block | Displays an element as a block element | I implemented this for my main section to ensure it was on its own line on the page                                                                                      |
| display-inline | Default value. Displays an element as an inline element | I implemented this on both the masthead and footer so the elements contained would display in a neat row. |
| centered | element is centered within its parent element | I implemented this in several places to have text look better, notably within boxes and tables |
| pseudo element | these target whole elements | I implemented this so the faux buttons on the top right would change color when you hover over them        |
| pseudo selector | these target only a portion of an element | I implemented this so that the first line of the lorem ispom was a different color and would draw the eye down to the "summary" |
| positional selector  | the position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, absolute or fixed). | i implemented these when placing the table and caption over the main images so i could control exactly where they were placed |
| selector combination | These are not exactly selectors themselves, but ways of combining two or more selectors in useful ways for very specific selections. | I implemented this to be very specific when applying css rules, to specify a rule on a child of a parent that shared a tag with another element i didn't want to effect. |
